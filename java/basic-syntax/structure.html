        2.1 - Directory and File Structure
      </h1>
      <p>
        In the first chapter, we saw how to create a new project in IntelliJ and
        print <code>&quot;hello world&quot;</code>. In doing so, we overlooked a
        lot of the details in-between, which we will review. Before we start
        coding anything else, we should have a basic understanding of the
        different layers in the hierarchy.
      </p>
      <h2 id="directories">Directories (Folders)</h2>
      <p>
        Within your operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux), you have
        directories. A <strong>directory</strong> is a computer storage location
        that can store files and other directories. These help to better
        organize your data, especially when programming. The term
        <em>directory</em> can be used synonymously with <em>folder</em>.
        <em>Directory</em> is the technical term, and <em>folder</em> is a
        general term. These terms may be used interchangeably throughout this
        book. While a directory is <em>technically</em> a special kind of file,
        it does not store data in the same way a &#39;normal&#39; file would. It
        holds information about the directories and files inside it, as well as
        metadata such as date created.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider the file path <code>C:/Users/Bob/data.txt</code>. It contains
        two directories, <code>Users</code> and <code>Bob</code>.
        <code>C</code> is a storage disk, and <code>data.txt</code> is a
        text-file. Directories are separated by slashes, typically forward
        slashes (<code>/</code>) for UNIX based systems, and backslashes
        (<code>\</code>) for Windows systems. Modern versions of Windows should
        support either type. Overall, forward slashes are the most common
        <em>directory separator</em>.
      </p>
      <h2 id="files">Files</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>file</strong> stores data as a sequence of bits (0s and 1s).
        Files can have <em>file extensions</em> to inform users and other
        programs how to interpret the file content. While all files hold binary
        data, there are two broad categories of files: binary and text.
        <strong>Binary files</strong> store data that <em>cannot</em> be easily
        understood as plain text, such as a <code>.exe</code> or
        <code>.png</code> file. <strong>Text files</strong> store data that
        <em>can</em> be easily understood as plain text, and are edited as plain
        text. File types such as <code>.txt</code>, <code>.html</code>, or
        <code>.java</code> are all plain-text files.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we write Java source code, we are editing a plain-text file ending
        with <code>.java</code>. The java compiler compile it into a
        <code>.class</code> file, which is a binary file that is
        <em>mostly</em> unreadable. The JVM (Java Virtual Machine), however, is
        specifically designed to read and execute <code>.class</code> files.
        Sometimes you will hear the term <em>binaries</em>, meaning multiple
        binary files. Binaries are generally larger than plain-text files.
        Plain-text files are used for writing source code, and are usually very
        small. Even 1,000,000 lines of code might only take up 50 MBs
        (megabytes).
      </p>
      <h2 id="enable-hidden-items-windows">Enable Hidden Items (Windows)</h2>
      <p>
        In Windows, the default behavior in File Explorer is to hide file
        extensions and hidden items. As a developer, it is unlikely that you
        will want this. To change this in Windows 10, open File Explorer and
        follow these steps (as shown in the image). I also recommend you enable
        file extensions
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Click View</li>
        <li>Expand Options</li>
        <li>Click <code>Hidden items</code></li>
        <li>(<em>Recommended</em>) Click <code>File name extensions</code></li>
      </ol>
      <p><img src="./img/win10_hidden_items.png" alt="image info" /></p>
      <h2 id="intellij-project">IntelliJ Project</h2>
      <p>
        A project in IntelliJ is a directory that contains a
        <code>.idea</code> directory, which mostly stores how your project is
        locally configured. Rarely will we need to directly edit any files in
        <code>.idea</code>.
      </p>
      <h3 id="intellij-modules">IntelliJ Modules</h3>
      <p>
        When a new project is created, a module with the same name is also
        created. This is indicated by the <code>*.iml</code> file. These are not
        to be confused with Java modules (a more advanced topic). Modules can
        also contain more modules, and we will use these later on to have
        multiple &quot;projects&quot; (modules) within a single base project.
        For now, we will just use the default module.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each new module automatically comes with a <em>sources root</em> called
        <code>/src</code>, which is short for <em>source</em>. This is where we
        will write our source code.
      </p>
      <h2 id="packages">Packages</h2>
      <p>
        Java has packages, which are essentially directories for your code. In
        fact, a package&#39;s name must match the corresponding directory&#39;s
        name. We will learn more about packages in a later chapter. For now, we
        will use the implicitly defined <em>default package</em>.
      </p>
      <h2 id="java-files-java-">Java Files (<code>.java</code>)</h2>
      <p>
        You have already seen a Java file when running the Hello World program.
        A Java file is what contains Java source code, such as
        <code>System.out.println()</code>. All Java files must go inside a
        package, and the <em>default package</em> counts.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>most important</strong> thing to know about Java files is
        that the file name <em>must</em> match the class name (excluding the
        file-extension, which must be <code>.java</code>). For example,
        <code>public class HelloWorld { ... }</code> <em>must</em> go inside
        <code>HelloWorld.java</code>, and
        <code>public class Example { ... }</code> <em>must</em> go inside
        <code>Example.java</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fortunately, this is rarely an issue you will encounter inside an IDE
        like IntelliJ, as creating a new class will automatically name the file
        correctly. But, if you manually try to rename your class (or file), you
        will have an error if both names don't match. Later on we will see how
        to properly <em>refactor</em> names in IntelliJ, which will
        automatically fix <em>both</em>.
      </p>
      <h3 id="class-declaration">Class Declaration</h3>
      <p>
        Near the top of the Java file, you will have something like
        <code>public class Example</code>. This is declaring a class named
        <code>Example</code>. After that, we open a set of curly braces
        <code>{ }</code> to write more code inside. Currently the only code we
        have seen inside is the <em>main method</em>.
      </p>
      <h4 id="methods">Methods</h4>
      <p>
        Classes can contain multiple <em>methods</em>. So far, we have only seen
        the <em>main method</em>:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="lang-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> main(<span class="hljs-keyword">String</span>[] args) {
    System.out.<span class="hljs-built_in">println</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"hello world"</span>);
}
</code></pre>

      <p>
        In a few chapters we will create more methods, but until then
        <strong>all</strong> of our code will go <em>inside</em>
        <code>public static void main(String[] args)</code>. We will focus on
        learning to write meaningful <em>statements</em> first.
      </p>
      <h5 id="statements">Statements</h5>
      <p>
        Methods contain <em>statements</em>. A <strong>statement</strong> tells
        your program to &quot;do something&quot;. This could be &quot;print
        hello world&quot;, such as with
        <code>System.out.println(&quot;hello world&quot;);</code>. In Java,
        <strong>all</strong> statements end with a
        <em>semicolon</em> (<code>;</code>). A common error for new programmers
        is to forget the semicolon. IntelliJ will give you an error/warning if
        it is missing, and your syntax-highlighting will likely appear broken.
      </p>
      <p>
        Methods can contain multiple statements, and usually do. For example, it
        is perfectly okay to write
      </p>
      <pre><code class="lang-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> main(<span class="hljs-keyword">String</span>[] args) {
    System.out.<span class="hljs-built_in">println</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Hello"</span>);
    System.out.<span class="hljs-built_in">println</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"World!"</span>);
}
</code></pre>
      <p>
        Here we have <em>two</em> statements, each one ending in a semicolon.
        They are part of the <em>main</em> method. The method starts with a
        <code>{</code> and ends with the matching <code>}</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you see an example statement such as <code>int x = 5;</code>,
        assume is is part of a larger file such as:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="lang-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">ExampleBoilerplate</span> {
    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">main</span>(<span class="hljs-params">String[] args</span>) </span>{
        <span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> x = <span class="hljs-number">5</span>;
    }
}</code></pre>
      <p>
        To keep things tidy, we will ignore most of this verbose
        <em>boilerplate code</em> that we haven&#39;t learned the full meaning
        of yet. However, for the coding exercises, the example solutions
        <em>will</em> contain the full code. That way you can copy-paste it and
        run it immediately (assuming the file name name matches!).
      </p>
      <h2 id="visual-summary">Visual Summary</h2>
      <p>
        We have covered a lot of the structure for the file system, an IntelliJ
        project, and even some stuff within a Java source file. The following
        images provide a visualization of how these are nested. Note that in
        some locations, multiples are allowed, such as having multiple methods,
        or multiple Java files.
