      <h1 id="3-1-variables">3.1 - Variables</h1>
      <p>
        A <strong>variable</strong> is a named location that stores a value
        inside a program. In Java, variables must have a <em>name</em> and a
        <em>type</em>. A <strong>type</strong>, or <em>datatype</em>, is the
        type of data a variable is allowed to hold. This could be a piece of
        text, a number, a picture, or nearly anything else. In the following
        sections, we will study what some of these types actually are in Java.
        But for now, some common datatypes used in this section are
        <code>int</code> and <code>double</code>. Sometimes a variable name is
        referred to as an <em>identifier</em>. But not all identifiers are
        variables; identifiers can also be method or class names. So we will
        call them variables unless referring to identifiers in general.
      </p>
      <p>
        Neither the type nor the name of a variable can be changed once it is
        created. The only part that can <em>vary</em> is the value, hence
        <em>variable</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout this chapter, we will use an analogy of a storage box. On the
        outside, we <em>must</em> write the name and datatype on it with a
        <em>permanent</em> marker. Here, the datatype is in parentheses.
      </p>
      <div class="d-flex justify-content-center align-items-center pb-4">
        <img
          src="./img/var_box.png"
          alt="Variable box"
          style="max-width: min(500px, 90%)"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        On the inside, we will have a piece of paper with a value. If we want to
        change the value of the variable (box), we <em>replace</em> the paper
        value with a new one, throwing away the original. When we
        <em>assign</em> a value to the variable (box), the piece of paper on the
        inside is the <em>only</em> thing that changes, the outside will
        <em>always</em> stay the same.
      </p>
      <h2 id="declaration">Declaration</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>variable declaration</strong> is a programming statement that
        <em>declares</em> a variable with a name and a type, but no value. This
        would be like grabbing a new box and writing the name and type on it.
        When just declaring a variable, there is no paper/value inside. This is
        called an <em>uninitialized</em> variable.
      </p>
      <div class="d-flex justify-content-center align-items-center p-3">
        <img
          src="./img/box_uninitialized.png"
          alt="Uninitialized variable box"
          style="max-width: min(500px, 90%)"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        The general form of a declaration is
        <code>DataType variableName;</code>. For example,
      </p>
      <div class="d-flex justify-content-left align-items-center pb-2">
        <img
          src="./img/declaration.png"
          alt="Declaration general form"
          style="max-width: min(300px, 100%)"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        When a variable is declared, it <strong>cannot</strong> be used until it
        is <em>initialized</em>. For this reason, it is uncommon to declare a
        variable without initializing it at the same time.
      </p>
      <h2 id="initialization">Initialization</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>variable initialization</strong> is a programming statement
        that <em>initializes</em> the value of a variable. The initial value
        must be the same datatype as the variable, or compatible with the type.
        We will see more on compatibility in the next section. In order to
        initialize a variable, we use the <em>assignment operator</em>, which is
        a single equal sign <code>=</code>.
      </p>
      <pre class="java bordered">
<span class="keyword">double</span> total; <span class="comment">// Declare</span>
total = <span class="literal">12.98</span>; <span class="comment">// Initialize</span>
</pre>
      <p>
        However, the above code is very rare. Instead, programmers usually
        declare <em>and</em> initialize a variable in the same statement:
      </p>
      <pre class="java bordered">
<span class="comment">// Declare and initialize</span>
<span class="keyword">double</span> total = <span class="literal">12.98</span>;
</pre>
      <p>
        The general form of a variable initialization is
        <code>DataType variableName = initialValue;</code>, and is better
        illustrated here:
      </p>
      <div class="d-flex justify-content-left align-items-center pb-2">
        <img
          src="./img/init.png"
          alt="Initialization general form"
          style="max-width: min(525px, 100%)"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        In our box analogy, this would be like putting this piece of paper
        inside the box labeled by <strong>total</strong>:
      </p>
      <div class="d-flex justify-content-center align-items-center pb-3">
        <img
          src="./img/box_double.png"
          alt="Variable Box Initialization"
          style="max-width: min(500px, 90%)"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        Variables can be initialized to more than just a constant. Often times,
        the value is the <em>result</em> of an <em>expression</em>. For example:
      </p>
      <pre class="java bordered">
<span class="comment">// Declare and initialize</span>
<span class="keyword">double</span> diameter = radius * <span class="literal">2</span>;
</pre>
      <p>
        Here, the <code>diameter</code> is initialized to <em>twice</em> the
        value of <code>radius</code>. So, if <code>radius</code> had a value of
        <strong>5</strong>, then <code>diameter</code> would be the result of
        <strong>5 * 2</strong>, which is <strong>10</strong>. Whenever we use
        the variable <code>diameter</code>, it does not recompute
        <code>radius * 2</code>. Instead, the result of the expression is the
        value that gets stored. As such, if we later assigned
        <code>radius = 7;</code>, then <code>diameter</code> would still be
        <strong>10</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>For example</p>
      <pre class="java bordered">
<span class="keyword">double</span> radius = <span class="literal">5</span>;
<span class="keyword">double</span> diameter = radius * <span class="literal">2</span>;
<span class="class">System</span>.out.<span class="method">println</span>(radius); <span class="comment">// 5</span>
<span class="class">System</span>.out.<span class="method">println</span>(diameter); <span class="comment">// 10</span>

radius = <span class="literal">7</span>; <span class="comment">// Update radius</span>
<span class="class">System</span>.out.<span class="method">println</span>(radius); <span class="comment">// 7</span>
<span class="class">System</span>.out.<span class="method">println</span>(diameter); <span class="comment">// 10</span>
</pre>
      <p>
        Later, when we learn about methods, we can use them in an expression
        too.
      </p>
      <h2 id="strongly-typed">Strongly-typed</h2>
      <p>
        Java is a <strong>strongly-typed</strong> langauge. This means that all
        variables have a datatype and the value <em>must</em> be compatible with
        the type. This typing also determines what the allowed operations are
        for that type (operators are in the next chapter). Any type violations,
        such as storing text in a number, will cause a compilation error.
      </p>
      <h2 id="using-a-variable">Using a variable</h2>
      <p>
        A variable can be used, or accessed, by its name. Uninitialized
        variables cannot be accessed, and will cause a compilation error if you
        try. To use a variable, simply type out the variable&#39;s name where
        you need it. For example, <code>System.out.println(radius);</code>. Any
        variable or expression can be printed with <code>print</code> and
        <code>println</code>. Variables can also be used in expressions, such as
        <code>radius * 2</code>. This expression reads the value from
        <code>radius</code> (by opening &quot;the box&quot;), and multiplies it
        by 2. Thus, you can also do <code>System.out.println(radius * 2)</code>,
        which prints the result of the expression <code>radius * 2</code>.
      </p>
      <h2 id="assignment">Assignment</h2>
      <p>
        An important part about variables is that they can <em>vary</em>. A
        variable can be assigned to a value with a compatible type using the
        <em>assignment operator</em> <code>=</code>. The value can be a
        <em>literal</em> or an expression. Here are some examples:
      </p>
      <pre class="bordered java">
<span class="comment">// literal</span>
<span class="keyword">int</span> x = <span class="literal">5</span>;

<span class="comment">// result of an expression</span>
<span class="keyword">int</span> y = x;

<span class="comment">// result of an expression</span>
<span class="keyword">int</span> z = x + <span class="literal">2</span>;
</pre>
      <h3 id="reassignment">Reassignment</h3>
      <p>
        Often times, you want to <em>update</em> the value of a variable after
        it has been initialized. This is called <strong>reassignment</strong>.
        The simplest form would be <code>variableName = value;</code>. Notice
        that the datatype is not declared again. Datatypes are only part of a
        variable declaration. When you reassign a variable, whatever data it
        previously stored is gone forever (unless you stored a copy in another
        variable). This is like replacing the paper in our box analogy.
      </p>
      <p>An example of reassignment is below:</p>
      <pre class="bordered java">
<span class="keyword">int</span> x = <span class="literal">5</span>;
<span class="class">System</span>.out.<span class="method">println</span>(x); <span class="comment">// 5</span>
x = <span class="literal">4</span>;
<span class="class">System</span>.out.<span class="method">println</span>(x); <span class="comment">// 4</span>
</pre>
      <h3 id="copying">Copying</h3>
      <p>
        When you assign a variable the <em>value</em> of another variable, it
        copies the value. In the box analogy, this would be like photocopying
        the paper in the original box, and placing the copy in the other box.
        After the value has been copied, anything that happens to either
        variable (box) is independent of the other. For example,
      </p>
      <pre class="bordered java">
<span class="keyword">int</span> x = <span class="literal">5</span>;
<span class="keyword">int</span> y = x; <span class="comment">// store a copy of x, which is 5</span>
x = <span class="literal">1</span> <span class="comment">// updates x only</span>
<span class="class">System</span>.out.<span class="method">println</span>(x); <span class="comment">// 1</span>
<span class="class">System</span>.out.<span class="method">println</span>(y); <span class="comment">// 5</span>
</pre>
      <p>
        <code>y</code> was assigned a copy of <code>x</code>, which had the
        value <strong>5</strong>. These are two separate boxes, so when we say
        <code>x = 1;</code>, only <code>x</code>&#39;s box is updated.
        Therefore, when we print out <code>y</code>, the copy of
        <strong>5</strong> is still stored.
      </p>
      <h3 id="chained-assignments">Chained assignments</h3>
      <p>
        Every so often, you will want to assign the <em>same</em> value to
        <em>multiple</em> variables. You can do this by <em>chaining</em> the
        assignment operator. Suppose you have a few variables holding counts of
        different things, and you want reset all of them to zero. Assuming all
        these variables are already declared (or initialized), you can write
      </p>
      <pre class="bordered java">
appleCount = orangeCount = bananaCount = <span class="literal">0</span>;
</pre>
      <p>
        This will only evaluate the expression on the right side <em>once</em>.
        In this example, <strong>0</strong> is assigned to
        <code>bananaCount</code>, then <code>bananaCount</code> is copied into
        <code>orangeCount</code>, and finally <code>orangeCount</code> is copied
        into <code>appleCount</code>. This is not used very often, but can
        occasionally simplify a few lines of code. The longer way of doing the
        previous block of code would be:
      </p>
      <pre class="bordered java">
appleCount = <span class="literal">0</span>;
orangeCount = <span class="literal">0</span>;
bananaCount = <span class="literal">0</span>;
</pre>
      <h2 id="multiple-declarations-and-initializations">
        Multiple declarations and initializations
      </h2>
      <p>
        It is possible to declare multiple variables in a single statement.
        While I strongly discourage you from using this, I am still presenting
        it so that you can read any code that does it. This can be done with a
        comma-separated list of variables, all holding the same type. For
        example,
      </p>
      <pre class="bordered java">
<span class="comment">// Declare 3 double variables</span>
<span class="keyword">double</span> x, y, z;
</pre>
      <pre class="bordered java">
<span class="comment">// Declare and initialize 3 double variables</span>
<span class="keyword">double</span> x = <span class="literal">0</span>, y = <span class="literal">1.5</span>, z = <span class="literal">72.5</span>;
</pre>
      <pre class="bordered java">
<span class="comment">// Declare and initialize some of the variables</span>
<span class="keyword">double</span> x, y = <span class="literal">1.5</span>, z;
</pre>
      <p>
        As you can see, once variable initializations are added, the readability
        becomes awful. It is not <em>that</em> bad to simple declare variables,
        but ultimately you will have to initialize them such as:
      </p>
      <pre class="bordered java">
<span class="comment">// Declare 3 double variables, then initialize</span>
<span class="keyword">double</span> x, y, z;
x = <span class="literal">0</span>;
y = <span class="literal">1.5</span>;
z = <span class="literal">72.5</span>;
</pre>
      <p>And at this point, you might as well have just done the normal way:</p>

      <pre class="bordered java">
<span class="comment">// Directly initialize 3 double variables</span>
<span class="keyword">double</span> x = <span class="literal">0</span>;
<span class="keyword">double</span> y = <span class="literal">1.5</span>;
<span class="keyword">double</span> z = <span class="literal">72.5</span>;
</pre>
      <h2 id="naming">Naming</h2>
      <p>
        The two hardest things in computer science are
        <em>cache invalidation</em> and <em>naming things</em>. This is a
        historical joke, but is accurate in a philosophical sense. For now, we
        will only look at one of them: naming things.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two main things to worry about: what we <em>could</em> name
        something, and what we <em>should</em> name something. The hard part is
        what you <em>should</em> name something. There are an infinite number of
        names you could choose, but which one would be the best? Would it be
        better to use <code>numberOfUsers</code>, <code>userCount</code>, or
        <code>totalUsers</code>? In this example, they are all good, but there
        will be other times when pinpointing a descriptive name is trickier.
      </p>
      <p>
        An important note is that variable names cannot be reused within the
        same <em>scope</em>. We will start to see scopes in a few chapters. So
        far, we have only used the scope of the <code>main</code>. This means
        that all your variable names inside <code>main</code> must be
        <em>unique</em>. Luckily, each method has its own set of unique variable
        names, or else we&#39;d have a <em>really</em> hard time naming things.
      </p>
      <h3 id="allowed-names">Allowed Names</h3>
      <p>
        An allowed name is what Java allows us to use - what we
        <em>could</em> use. Remember that Java is case-sensitive, so
        <code>Total</code> would be different than <code>total</code>. Here are
        the naming rules:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cannot have whitespace.</li>
        <li>Must start with a letter, <code>$</code>, or <code>_</code>.</li>
        <li>
          Subsequent characters can be letters, numbers, <code>$</code>, and
          <code>_</code>.
        </li>
        <li>Cannot be a reserved keyword.</li>
        <li>Can be context-sensitive keywords.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="reserved-keywords">Reserved Keywords</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Reserved keywords</strong>, commonly called <em>keywords</em>,
        are special tokens that <em>cannot</em> be used as an identifier. Some
        keywords that we have already seen are <code>public</code>,
        <code>static</code>, <code>void</code>, and <code>class</code>. A table
        listing all of the reserved keywords is below. You do not need to
        memorize them. We will slowly learn about the different keywords when we
        cover their respective topics. (Most of them wouldn&#39;t make be good
        variable names anyways.)

      <h4 id="contextual-keywords">Contextual Keywords</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Contextual keywords</strong> are keywords that are only reserved
        in certain situations. Most of these keywords were only added to newer
        versions of Java, so if they were fully reserved, old Java code using
        these keywords as variables wouldn't compile. So, contextual keywords
        were added to help with forwards-compatibility, meaning old code should
        still work on newer versions.

        Java Variable Naming Conventions
      </h3>
      <p>
        Now that we know what we <em>could</em> name a variable, lets discuss
        how you <em>should</em> (or <em>shouldn&#39;t</em>) name something.
        These rules are called <em>naming conventions</em>, and they help to
        keep Java source code consistent. That way, any Java developer could
        join any project and wouldn&#39;t have to learn a new set of rules, or
        would be able to read other developers code more easily. Most
        programming languages have well-established conventions, not just Java.
        The standard variable naming conventions in Java are as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use lower camel-case.</li>
        <li>Do not use a <code>$</code> in variable names.</li>
        <li>Do not use <code>_</code> in variable names (except constants).</li>
        <li>Do not use any context-sensitive keywords as variable names.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In addition to the standard rules, there are also some common naming
        recommendations. Avoid using abbreviations and acronyms unless they are
        well-known, such as HTML or GUI. This would also include avoiding
        <code>no</code> or <code>num</code> instead of <code>number</code>.
      </p>
      <h4 id="lower-camel-case">Lower Camel Case</h4>
      <p>
        Lower camel-case is a naming format to combine multiple words into a
        single identifier (without spaces). It is defined by starting with a
        lowercase letter, and then the first letter of each subsequent word
        capitalized. In the end, the identifier somewhat resembles the humps on
        a camel&#39;s back. Here is a table of examples:
