# 3.3 - Strings
A `String` is one of the most common Java reference types. A **string** refers to a *string of characters* or *sequence of characters*. Strings are common across almost every programming language, sometimes under a slightly different name (such as *text*), and are usually implemented with a array of characters (`char[]` in Java). An important part of Strings is that they have a string-literal syntax to directly construct and use. This differs from every other reference type, excluding arrays, because there are no literals for anything else. All reference-types are *objects*, so `String` is an object!

In this section, we cover the basics of Strings, and in the next section we will learn about the details of reference-types (objects). In a few chapters we will revisit strings in greater detail

## String Literals
Java Strings can be constructed with a literal syntax by enclosing the characters in double-quotes. For example,
```java
System.out.println("I am a String literal");
```
We have already seen these before, when printing `"hello world"` and other things. But, now that we know the actual data type, we can assign it to a variable and *use* that variable:
```java
String greeting = "hello world";
System.out.println(greeting);
```

Recall that `char` literals use single-quotes, like `'h'`. So the literal `'h'` would be a `char`, whereas the literal `"h"` would be a `String`, even though they are both a single character long.

Speaking of single-character, what if you don't want any characters at all? With a `char`, this is not possible, but with a `String` it is. An *empty string* is made with two consecutive double-quotes. For example, `String empty = "";`. This might seem useless at first, but I can promise you that it will be useful.

### Escape Sequences
Like `char` literals, there are also escape sequences for characters within a String. They are as follows
* `\b` backspace
* `\s` space
* `\t` tab
* `\n` newline
* `\f` form feed
* `\r` carriage return
* `\'` single-quote
* `\"` double-quote
* `\\` backslash

In terms of the single-quote and double-quote, it is the opposite of `char`'s rules. Consider the table below:
| Character    | `char` literal | `String` literal |
| -------- | ------- | --------|
| `'`  | `'\''` | `"'"` or `"\'"` |
| `"` | `'"'` or `'\"'`  | `"\""`

There are also octal escapes for both `String` and `char`, which are basically useless and only support the decimal range of 0 to 255 (inclusive). But, for completeness I am mentioning them. They look like `\103` which would be the character `C` (decimal value `67`). The octal range of 0 to 255 is `0` to `377`, and the escapes must not begin with leading zeros.

### Hexadecimal Escapes & Unicode Literals
Recall that Java strings are UTF-16, just like `char`. But, because `char` is only 16-bit, two chars are necessary to store a 32-bit surrogate-pair. This makes it so 32-bit character literals are un-representable in a `char` literal, as two `char` values are needed for it. But, because `String` is a sequence of characters, a 32-bit surrogate-pair character *can* be represented in a String, and also in String literals. You can, of course, still use two 16-bit hexadecimal escapes to encode a pair, but it is not needed. Both of these print statements print the same value, which is *mathematical bold capital sigma* `0x1d6ba`:
```java
System.out.println("\uD835\uDEBA");
System.out.println("ùö∫");
```
Likely the most common use-case for surrogate-pairs is with emojis, so the following print statements both print the rocket emoji (üöÄ):
```java
System.out.println("üöÄ");
System.out.println("\uD83D\uDE80");
```

*Warning:* The Java API has some inconsistencies related to 32-bit surrogate-pairs and indexing Strings with pairs (since it requires 2 chars). Check method documentation and test your use-case when dealing with surrogate-pairs in String computations.

## Text Blocks (Multiline String Literals)
Sometimes it is necessary to encode several lines of text, and doing this with "normal" String literals can be difficult to read and write. All the escapes for `\n` can make it difficult to visualize the output, and it must go on a single line, so it becomes a massive horizontal mess. There were some workarounds, such as string concatenation, but there wasn't a standard way in the past.
Fortunately, in Java 15, text blocks were added to solve this problem.

**Text blocks** are a special alternative to String literals. This allows for improved readability by reducing the amount of escapes necessary (especially newlines). They begin with 3 double-quotes followed by a newline in the source code, and end with 3 double-quotes. For example,
```java
String example = """
        The first line
        The second line
        The third line
        """;
```
The above example is equivalent to:
```java
String example = "The first line\nThe second line\nThe third line\n";
```
Therefore, if we were to print the example, it would look like:
```
The first line
The second line
The third line

```
Notice how we are stuck with a final `\n`, which is sometimes undesirable and possibly confusing. There are a few workarounds to this. The first would be to simply have the `"""` appear at the end of the final line:
```java
String example = """
        The first line
        The second line
        The third line""";
```

But, I personally do not like the location of the closing `"""` here, and prefer to instead use the special `\<line-terminator>` escape sequence, discussed in a moment:
```java
String example = """
        The first line
        The second line
        The third line\
        """;
```

Both of these solutions will result in the string:
```
The first line
The second line
The third line
```

### Escape Sequences
All of the escape sequences from String literals translate to text-blocks. However, the escapes `\n`, `\t`, `\s`, `\'`, and `\"` are generally not needed, but `\b`, `\f`, `\r`, and `\\` are. This results in much nicer looking strings such as
```java
String example = """
        "I can't believe how nice text-blocks are", she said.
        """;
```

If you find yourself needing to encode `"""` inside the text-block, you will need to escape at least one of the quotes, like `\"""`. It would also be possible to do `\"\"\"`, but that starts to make it difficult to read again! Note that the `\"""` only works for every 3 quotes, so `\""""` would not be correct (the final three `"""` would end the text-block). Instead, you would need to write `\"""\"`.

#### `\<line-terminator>`
This is a special escape sequence that can only appear inside text-blocks. We have already seen this in our example to remove a trailing newline. This escape sequence prevents the newline within the source code from making its way into the compiled String. This can be useful to reduce the width of a text-block, without adding any new lines. Consider this example:
```java
// String literal, horizontal scrolling
String loremIpsumLiteral = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Deleniti qui harum nostrum aut, dolore iste! Iste quae, culpa aliquam iure temporibus atque. Vitae tenetur tempore veritatis? Ullam aspernatur repellat minima veniam a, vel repellendus libero deleniti aliquam.";

// Text block, no horizontal scrolling
String loremIpsumBlock = """
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur \
        adipisicing elit. Deleniti qui harum \
        nostrum aut, dolore iste! Iste quae, \
        culpa aliquam iure temporibus atque. \
        Vitae tenetur tempore veritatis? Ullam \
        aspernatur repellat minima veniam a, \
        vel repellendus libero deleniti aliquam.\
        """
```
Both strings store the same text and would print out the same. The difference here
is that in the text-block, we are able to manually wrap the text in the source code *without* adding a newline. And because there is a space before the `\`, the space is kept. If the space was omitted, the lines would squished together. In this next example, the resulting Strings are the same:
```java
String hi1 = "helloworld";
String hi2 = """
        hello\
        world\
        """;
```

### Leading Whitespace
So far, all of the leading whitespace has been ignored. That is because the Java compiler considers it to be *incidental whitespace*. This is to help with formatting your code, without causing an actual indentation.

There are a lot of detailed rules for this, so I will just summarize the main points. Whichever non-whitespace character comes first, or the closing `"""`, is the base indentation level. When the closing `"""` is not on a line by itself, the first non-whitespace is used as the base indentation. In the following examples, the multi-line comments represent what the resulting string would become.

```java
/*
one
  two
three
*/
String block1 = """
        one
          two
        three
        """;

/*
  one
two
    three
*/
String block2 = """
          one
        two
            three
        """;
/*
  one
  two
  three
*/
String block3 = """
          one
          two
          three
        """;

/*
one
two
three
*/
String block4 = """
        one
        two
        three
           """;

/*
one
  two
three
*/
String block5 = """
        one
          two
        three
           """;

/*
one
  two
three
*/
String block6 = """
        one
          two
        three""";
```

Note that the leading whitespace should all be the same type (spaces or tabs). If they are mixed together, tabs are treated as a single space when calculating the indentation.

### Trailing Whitespace
Trailing whitespaces (whitespace at the end of a line) are automatically removed by the compiler. If you need the trailing whitespaces, you can use the `\s` escape for a space (and any whitespace before it is kept). So `hello \s` would be `hello` followed by *two* spaces. Another option is `\<line-terminator>`, but that will remove the newline as well. It is extremely rare that you will need to keep a trailing whitespace, but if you do typically a single space `\s` would suffice. If you really need trailing whitespace *and* a newline, you could combine escapes with `\n\`. For anything more complicated, I would recommend writing some type of right-padding code after the text-block.


## Concatenation
**String concatenation** is a way to combine two strings into one, by appending the characters of the second to the end of the first. For example, you have the String `"hello"` and the String `"world"`, and you want the result of concatenation would be `"helloworld"`. This is done in Java with the `+` operator. Think of it as *adding* the strings together, one after the other. This can be done with both literals and variables. 

Consider this example:
```java
String x = "hello"
String y = "world"
// prints "hello world"
System.out.println(x + " " + y)
```
The variables `x` and `y` are poorly named, but used to show the distinction that it doesn't print the *name* of the variables, it prints the *value* of the variables. First, `x` and `" "` (a space) are concatenated into the value `"hello "`, and then `"hello "` and `y` are concatenated into the value `"hello world"`. In total, there were *two* string concatenations.

A common mistake is forgetting to add a separator between variables, reducing the readability of the output. For example, printing `System.out.println(x + y);` would result in `"helloworld"`, likely a logic error. Another common mistake is forgetting to add the `+` between everything, such as `x + " " y`, which is a syntax error.

While not shown in the previous example, another common bug is forgetting a trailing space on a string-literal message. For example,
```java
String confirmationNumber = "A12345";
// Bug: "Confirmation number:A12345"
System.out.println("Confirmation number:" + confirmationNumber);

// Correct: "Confirmation number: A12345"
System.out.println("Confirmation number: " + confirmationNumber);
```

In the next chapter, we cover different operators, including `+`, where we will learn about how `+` interacts with different data types. The most important part is that String concatenation *only* happens when one of the operands is a `String`. Otherwise, it will perform numerical addition (or it won't compile if neither addition or concatenation are possible).

## Type Conversions
In the last section, we saw that we can cast between every primitive type (except booleans), and learned the rules for that. Now, we will learn how to convert primitive types to Strings, Strings to primitives, and Objects to Strings.



### Primitives to Strings
The primitive types, like `int` and `double`, can be converted into a String in two major ways. The *cheesy* way is to concatenate an empty string and the primitive together. For example:
```java
int x = 5;
String s = "" + x;
```
While this is nice and easy, it is sometimes considered bad practice. Though, many times you will have a non-empty string you can append to, such as `"User ID: " + x`, which is fine.

The more preferable way is to invoke a static method on the `String` class, or a wrapper class. The static method `String.valueOf(primitive)` will work for all primitives (e.g. `String.valueOf(123)`).  Internally, that will use one of the following wrapper methods:
* `Boolean.toString(boolean)`
* `Character.toString(char)`
* `Integer.toString(int)`
* `Long.toString(long)`
* `Float.toString(float)`
* `Double.toString(double)`


Both approaches (empty strings and static methods) are equally fast on modern Java versions (17+). I will use both, though I typically use the empty-string concatenation unless I am operating on the resulting String (e.g. `String.valueOf(5).length()` instead of `("" + 5).length()`)

### Strings to Primitives
Converting from a String to a primitive is done through the static methods on the wrapper classes. There is no cheesy version for this. Assuming `s` is a `String`, the following lists each of the static methods for converting into the corresponding primitive:

* `Byte.parseByte(s)`
* `Short.parseShort(s)`
* `Integer.parseInt(s)`
* `Long.parseLong(s)`
* `Float.parseFloat(s)`
* `Double.parseDouble(s)`
* `Boolean.parseBoolean(s)`

What happens if the String cannot be converted? You will get a `NumberFormatException` at runtime in all cases except `Boolean.parseBoolean`. This works differently by only returning `true` if and only if the input String is `"true"` (case-insensitive), otherwise false.

In some texts you may see the usage of `Integer.valueOf(s)`, `Long.valueOf(s)`, etc. These methods are generally considered bad practice because they *do not* return primitive types. They return the wrapper types. This means if you were to write `int x = Integer.valueOf("5");` you are undergoing both *boxing* and *unboxing*, which have a tiny performance hit and are not needed. If you *do* need a wrapper type,  you can just autobox the result with `Integer x = Integer.parseInt(x);` and never use `valueOf` (though, `valueOf` would be acceptable for this use-case).

The most important takeaway from this subsection is to remember `Integer.parseInt(s)`. If you remember that, you should be able to recall the other parse methods. We will use this a fair amount when we start interacting with the user from the command line input.

### Objects to Strings
To represent an Object as a String, the safest way it to use `String.valueOf(obj)`. This prevents NullPointerExceptions from directly invoking `obj.toString()`. The string concatenation operator (`+`) will do the same thing as `String.valueOf(obj)` if one of the operands is a String. So assuming `today` and `weatherReport` are reference type variables (with a custom `toString`):
```java
// The weather on 1970-01-01 is partly cloudy
System.out.println("The weather on " + today + " is " + weatherReport);
```
