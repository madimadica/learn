# 3.3 - Primitive Wrapper Classes
A *wrapper class* is a class that *wraps* a variable with additional behavior (methods). A **primitive wrapper class** is a wrapper class around one of the 8 primitive data types in Java. They begin with a capital letter, since they are classes, and use the full name of the primitive. Since these are not primitive types anymore, they are our first reference types. The table below lists all of them:

| Primitive    | Wrapper Class | 
| -------- | ------- |
| boolean | Boolean |
| byte | Byte |
| short | Short |
| int | Integer |
| long | Long |
| char | Character |
| float | Float |
| double | Double |

The wrappers are *reference* type alternatives to their corresponding primitive type (e.g. `int` and `Integer`). They can be used interchangeably via *autoboxing* and *unboxing*.

## Boxing and Autoboxing
**Boxing** is converting a primitive type into its wrapper class. This can be done by calling the static `valueOf` method on a wrapper class, such as `Integer.valueOf(5)` or `Character.valueOf('x');`

**Autoboxing** is when the compiler automatically *boxes* a primitive value for you. This was introduced in Java 5, and you should use autoboxing instead of manual boxing. The following example shows both:
```java
// Manual Boxing (before Java 5)
Integer x = Integer.valueOf(5);

// Autoboxing (Java 5+)
Integer y = 5;
```

## Unboxing
**Unboxing** occurs when a primitive-wrapper is converted into the primitive value. Starting in Java 5, the compiler automatically does this, just like with autoboxing. You can still perform a manual unboxing by calling `intValue()`, `doubleValue()`, etc. on a wrapper object.
```java
Integer x = 5;

// Auto Unboxing
int y = x;

// Manual Unboxing
int z = x.intValue();
```
As we have not learned about instance methods yet, and have barely learned about static methods, it is perfectly fine, and encouraged, to use autoboxing and unboxing.

## Performance and Caching
Since the wrapper classes are objects, and not primitives, they come with a minimal performance hit. So you really shouldn't use a wrapper object unless you need to.

To improve performance, certain wrapper values/objects are cached. This happens for the booleans `true` and `false`, characters between 0 and 255, and all integer types (byte/short/long/double) between -128 to 127. This can lead to some unintended consequences with equality checks (`==` and `!=`), which we will revisit in the next chapter.

## Purpose
The main reason for using a primitive wrapper is to be able to use it as an *Object*. These are necessary for use with generics, as they only work with Object types. These are most often used with the Java Collections framework. As an example, you cannot have a `List<int>`, and instead need to use `List<Integer>`. We will learn about generics and collections in several chapters, which is where our main usage of these will come in. For now, our main usage of the wrapper classes is for their static methods. 

## Overview of Static Methods
A static method is called by starting with the class name, then the dot-operator (`.`), then the method name, and finally the method arguments (if any). For example, in `Integer.valueOf(5)`, the class name is `Integer` and the method name is `valueOf`, and `5` is the argument.

Methods have a *return type*, which is either a data-type (primitive or reference), or *void*. A **void** return type means it does not return anything, so it cannot be assigned to a variable or used in an expression. Both `print` and `println` are examples of void methods. You cannot say `int x = System.out.println(5);`, for example. 

There are some useful static methods on the wrapper classes for converting between Strings, primitives, and wrappers, as we will see in the next section. There are also some useful bit-manipulation methods on the numerical wrappers, but these are quite niche.
